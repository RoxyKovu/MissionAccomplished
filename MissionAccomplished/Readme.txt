Whether you're monitoring your XP efficiency, tracking critical combat stats, or receiving vital alerts, MissionAccomplished ensures you stay informed and prepared on your journey to level 60.

Key Features:

Advanced XP Tracking
• Monitor XP progress, XP/hour, and total XP gained.
• Estimate time to level 60 based on your progression rate.

• Easily reposition the XP bar via SHIFT+Drag.
• Click the Gavrial icon to open settings.

Gavrial’s Call Notifications
• Real-time, customizable alerts for low HP warnings, level-ups, dungeon entries, guild-wide events, and more.
• A dynamic event icon updates within a refined, semi-transparent notification frame, while a static icon fixed at the upper left offers quick settings access.
• Incoming messages are queued and displayed sequentially to ensure no alert is missed.
• Uses a hidden chat channel ("GavrialcallsHCeventscodes") for secure event syncing.

Naglet’s Toolkit (Utility Panel)
• In-game tools including Ready Check, Roll, a 10s Timer, and Clear Marks.
• Additional functions to reset combat data, test event alerts, and broadcast progress to your guild.
• System utilities for UI reload, cache clearing, FPS monitoring, and screenshot capture.

Armory & Stats Panel
• Displays detailed character statistics and combat performance via an integrated Armory view (Mahler’s Armory).
• The panel continuously updates combat and progression data.
• The guild member list is automatically sorted by online status (online first), then by level (highest to lowest), and finally by name (alphabetically).
• The header shows average level, the number of level‑60 members, and the total number of guild members.

Guild Functions Section
• Provides a dedicated tab that displays a comprehensive, scrollable list of all guild members.
• Online members appear at the top, followed by offline members; both groups are sorted by level (descending) then by name.
• Each guild member’s entry includes visual icons (race, class, trophy for high level) and detailed information such as level, addon progress (if available), or offline status.
• The section also features a statistics panel summarizing guild-wide data and a grid showing class counts with faction availability details.
• This section makes it easier to monitor guild composition and key statistics at a glance.

Customizable Notifications
• Guild-wide alerts for critical events (e.g., low HP warnings, player deaths, dungeon transitions, level-up milestones) are delivered via a hidden chat channel so that only add-on users receive them.
• UI elements can be repositioned using SHIFT+Drag, with quick settings accessible via slash commands (/maopts or /macomp) or dedicated icons.

Centralized Calculations
• All core calculations (XP tracking, combat stats, time played, etc.) are handled in one central Core module to ensure consistent data across the add-on.
